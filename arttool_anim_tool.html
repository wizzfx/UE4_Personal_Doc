          <h3>Epic Animation Rigging Tool Tips ( Exporting Rigged Character from Maya to UE4 ).</h3>
          <h4>
            1. build rig.
            - creating skeleton ( set number of bones ).
              + add rig modules ( we can add more bones for different type of elements ).
              + we can save created template at this stage.
            - creating placement for our skeleton ( putting elements and joints in desired position ).
              + you can build and rebuild your preview skeleton.
              + symmetry mode for realtime symmetry ( you can tunr it OFF/ON ).
              + you can lock mirror for selected elements.
              + modifying mannequin mesh in mesh mode.
            - creating rig pose ( rig pose is your T-pose ).
              + program will try to put your rig from model pose into T-pose, you can modify it for better results.
              + you can switch between model pose and rig pose.
            - weighting / skinning.
              + paint weight tool.
              + you can export / import skin weights.
              + you can mirror weights.
              + you can set range of motions ( it bakes motions for selected bones to timeline in order to test skin weights ).
            - building control rig.
              + publishing our character ( set preset, set name of character ). Controls for rig will be automatically build.
              + you can edit created character.
              + Edit Export File ( skin weights, placements for joints ).
              + Edit Rig File ( number of bones, names ).
              + after makind edits for example for skin weights you can save character file, remember to save it in rig pose not model pose.
              + after making simple changes you don't have to rebuild rig controls, do it only if it is necessery.
              + saved changes will be visible in animations that are using these rigs.
            2. add character for animation.
            - different functions of control rig.
              + knee rotation.
              + auto hips ( hips are automatically rotated by legs ).
              + auto spine ( middle spine is also moving when moving ends of the spine ).
              + auto shoulders ( nice important feature ).
              + head settings ( for example world position ).
              + spine stretch.
              + arms stretch.
              + FK and IK ON/OFF.
              + FK and IK for fingers + pull vector.
              + Master, Offset, Root ( main controlers ).
            - Export motion ( exporting anim to fbx ).
              + rotation interpolation ( quatrenian slerp or something, preferable for UE4 ).
              + export morph targets.
            - importing motions.
              + import mocap data.
              + importing selected animations.
            - space switcher?
            - pose editor.
              + copy/paste position of the elements ( for example leg position can be copied to the other side ).
              + load full body poses for character.
              + save poses.
            - match over frame range.
            3. Exporting skeleton and mesh to UE4.
            - pick from A.R.T menu "edit existing character".
            - select your character and chose "edit export file".
            - in outliner select root and mesh and go to file > export selection.
